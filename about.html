        Team 9575 has the mission to create a friendly and motivating
        environment for people who like working with robotics in general. We
        want to give students of all grades the opportunity to gain experience
        in collaboration, leadership, communication, and so on. Our team
        consists of people from all kinds of backgrounds, so it would be an
        excellent chance for students to develop social networking skills and
        connections. Our goal in competitions would provide wonderful experience
        dealing with challenges, overcoming issues, as well as taking
        responsibilities. Team 9575 promises all members helpful and interesting
        moments with engineering, mechanics, and management.
